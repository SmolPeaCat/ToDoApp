TODO:
- Add Images of my app
- Add more details and explanation of my app
- Hopefully don't forget to create an entry blog for this app

What I learned :
- Mvvm
- Singleton Pattern

What I accomplished
- Creates a new window every time you click on Create Note
- Delete the note when you click on Done ( was wy too hard for no reason)
- In the add Todos you can add a todo ! and it only limits you to one window
- Make a beatiful background
- You can simply press Enter to create a new todo and create one
- You can simply press Esc to escape from the Todo Add window
- MY application is Blazingly fast and powered by MvvM !

Other stuff to implement
- Add a way to keep the previous todos (database)
- Bring a new style to the application
